the skeleton source is in src
there is an ant build file with a war target, this will build a deployable war for you
in the tools directory you will find ant and jetty, if you wish you can deploy this war in the jetty web apps folder

alternatively you can execute the Bootstrap main method, to do this you will need to include tools/jetty-hightide-7.2.2.v20101205/lib directory contents in your classpath

either way will result in a server deployed at http://localhost:8080/simplefruit/api

endpoints:
GET fruit: /fruit
GET image: /image/{fruit_id}
